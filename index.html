            <p>Sex is a natural form of expression all creatures are born with. It should be as simple as eating or sleeping. But along the way, we have been taught to feel shame. We’ve been hurt and traumatized. We’ve been made to feel less than others because we don’t meet some artificial standard of beauty.</p>

            <p>This causes us to pull back, close off, and shut down. We neglect that part of ourselves where our deepest desires live. We avoid the expressions that would give us the greatest satisfaction and fulfillment. We tell ourselves stories like, we don’t have time for that, or that we’ll just get hurt again. In the honest moments, we can admit that we just don’t know what to do. We just don’t know how to find the faith, the trust, the courage...</p>

            <p>Some of us have never had the joy of sexual intimacy between two people. Many of us dream of returning to that place of sexual expression and fulfillment that seems so long ago and far away. We think we’ve lost the spark. For all of us, the past year of isolation, the lack of human touch, has left us with an emptiness.</p>

            <p>There is a pain and sadness in all of us that is waiting for acknowledgment, acceptance, and release.</p>

            <p>We can find, we can get back to, we can lay claim to a life of full and fulfilling intimacy. I have no doubt that we can all integrate the knowledge, experience, and acceptance of our deepest, most primal desires into the full expression of masculinity and femininity in our day to day lives.</p>

            <p>Imagine moving through life comfortably and gracefully. Wouldn’t it be wonderful to be able to have easy, enjoyable conversations with anyone, anywhere? What would it be like to easily, comfortably make friends and lovers? What would it feel, look, sound like, if it was just as smooth and natural as breathing to have real connection and rapport after just a few minutes with anyone we meet? How satisfying would it be able to build meaningful relationships as we simply go about our everyday lives?</p>

            <p>When you join me in this quest, that is where we are going.</p>

            <p class="lessspace">I will work with you by:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Providing a safe space to express your desires.</li>
              <li>Helping you examine your beliefs, desires, and motivations</li>
              <li>Guiding you through exercises that will awaken your awareness and passions</li>
              <li>Discovering the beauty and strength that you are truly capable of</li>
            </ul>

          <h2>About me</h2>
            <p style="margin-top: 0px">I have been helping men and women overcome their sexual issues for many years.</p>

            <p>I am committed to being strongly compassionate and sympathetic.</p>
            
            <p>There is no greater calling for me than helping the world discover the beauty, the creativity, the joy that comes from the fullest expression of the polarity of femininity and masculinity. I can help you ignite a passion you thought you had lost forever or that you thought you could never experience.</p>
        
            <p>I believe all women are beautiful graceful goddesses and all men are powerful passionate lovers. We all have our wrinkles and freckles and scars but none of that can hide the beauty I can see in you. We all carry in us the higher nature of humankind. The challenge is to encourage and evoke the fullest expression of that higher nature. Everyone has access to the full range of our sensuality and sexual expression if we are given the safety, trust, and acceptance to discover them.</p>
        
            <p>My approach is deeply intuitive. I combine various practices with an attitude of compassion and acceptance in order to guide you to an easy, comfortable place of sexual health and expression. I have developed my counseling techniques over many years out of a genuine desire to help men and women achieve self esteem through sexual expressiveness.</p>
            
            <p>Several years of teaching at a local college showed me that I am one of the people who learns by teaching. We nourish each other. I am on this journey with you.  After being told by many people how much I have helped their lives, and having retired from my previous profession, I am now dedicated to counseling and coaching in order to help women and men to find grace, comfort and fulfillment in the understanding and expression of their own sexuality.
