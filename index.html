            <p>Sex is a natural form of expression all creatures were born with.  It should be as simple as eating or sleeping.  But along the way, we been taught to feel shame, or been hurt and traumatized, or been made to feel less than because we dont meet some artificial standard of beauty.</p>
            <p>This causes us to shut down, and neglect that part of ourselves where our deepest desires live.  We tell ourselves stories, like we dont have time for that, or that we will just get hurt again. </p>

            <p>There is a pain and sadness there that is waiting for acknowledgment and release.</p>
            <p class="lessspace">I will work with you by:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Providing a safe space to express your desires.</li>
              <li>Helping you examine your beliefs and motivations</li>
              <li>Guiding you through exercises that will awaken your passions</li>
              <li>Discovering the depths of what you are capable of</li>
            </ul>

          <h2>About me</h2>
            <p style="margin-top: 0px">I have been helping men and women overcome their sexual issues for many years.</p>

            <p>I am deeply compassionate and symphatetic and feel there is no greater calling than healing the world of sexual trauma.</p>
            
            <p>I can help you re-ignite a passion you thought you had lost forever or thought you could never experience.</p>
        
            <p>I beleive all women are beautiful goddesses and all men are passionate lovers.  Everyone has access to their
                full depths of sensuality if they are shown how to reach them.</p>
        
            <p>My approach is deeply intuitive, I combines various practices to guide you to a place of health. I developed my healing
              techniques over many years out of a genuine desire to help men and women acheive self esteem through sexual expressiveness.
              After being told by many people how much I have helped their lives, and having retired from my previous profession, I have
              now dedicated my life to healing.
