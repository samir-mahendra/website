            <h2>What will happen during the sessions?</h2>
            <p style="margin-top: 0px">Every client's experience is different based on their unique history and experience.  But generally speaking,
                I will ask you a series of questions to understand your situation and slowly guide you via various imagination, writing and touching
                exercises to a place of full expression.  Some of these exercises will be during sessions, and some will be
                assigned as homework.</p>

            <h2>Is the homework necessary? Can I just do the sessions only?</h2>
            <p style="margin-top: 0px">You can, but doing the inter-session exercises and writing assignments will help you get to a place of full expression 
                faster.</p>

            <h2>How many sessions do I need?  How often should I have sessions?</h2>
            <p style="margin-top: 0px">It depends on your past and on how far you want to go. There are many layers to the process of becoming a naturally sexual
                being, and usually several sessions are required, but even one can be helpful.  Schedule a <a href="https://calendly.com/jimsymons/">free 30 minute session</a> to learn more.</p>

            <h2>Are couples sessions available?</h2>
            <p style="margin-top: 0px">I am not a couples counsellor.  Sexual expression is deeply personal and while I am happy to help
                couples improve their sex lives, each member of the couple will need to have individual sessions with me.

            <p style="margin-top: 0px">This is a time for us to get to know each other and to answer any questions you may have. Any information you
                would like to share about yourself, what you are hoping to achieve from this work and assess if this is a
                good fit.

            <h2>Initial sessions.</h2>
            <p style="margin-top: 0px">
                After the free consultation, we will setup 3 half hour sessions to dive into your particular situation, with some time in
                between them to let your body soak in the new information and to work on exercises.  The 3 sessions package is $150.
